          <h2 className="h3 my-4">What Is The Bitcoin Rainbow Chart?</h2>
          <p>
            The Rainbow Chart is a long-term valuation tool designed to give you
            an idea of where Bitcoin might be headed. It uses a logarithmic
            growth curve, which basically means it expects Bitcoinâ€™s price to
            grow steadily over time, rather than in a straight line. The chart
            overlays rainbow-colored bands on top of this growth curve, with
            each color representing different levels of market sentiment. As
            Bitcoinâ€™s price moves through these colorful stages, the chart
            attempts to highlight potential opportunities to buy or sell. Itâ€™s a
            colorful way of seeing market emotions in action! But remember, this
            is for educational and entertainment purposes only. Just because
            Bitcoin has followed the rainbow pattern so far, doesnâ€™t mean it
            will in the future. So, take it with a grain of saltâ€”or a pot of
            gold, if youâ€™re lucky!
