            <p>
              Crypto staking is the process of participating in transaction
              validation on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain. Unlike
              Proof-of-Work (used by Bitcoin) which requires mining hardware,
              PoS networks rely on participants locking up (staking) their
              cryptocurrency holdings to help secure the network and validate
              new blocks.
            </p>
            <p>
              By staking your coins, you essentially act as a validator (or
              delegate your coins to a validator). In return for contributing to
              the network&apos;s security and operation, you receive staking
              rewards, typically paid out in the same cryptocurrency you staked.
              It&apos;s a way to potentially earn passive income on your crypto
              holdings. Learn more in our guide:{" "}

              How Staking Rewards Work & APY Explained
            </h2>
            <p>
              Staking rewards generally come from the network&apos;s inflation
              (new coins being created) and sometimes a portion of transaction
              fees. The amount you earn is often expressed as an{" "}
              <strong>Annual Percentage Yield (APY)</strong>.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>APY vs. APR:</strong> APY includes the effect of
                compounding (earning rewards on your previously earned rewards),
                while Annual Percentage Rate (APR) usually does not. Be sure
                which figure your platform provides when inputting into
                calculators.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Variability:</strong> Staking APYs are{" "}
                <strong>highly variable</strong> and not fixed interest rates.
                They depend on factors like the total amount of crypto staked on
                the network (more staked often means lower APY per participant),
                the network&apos;s reward schedule, validator uptime, and
                sometimes the price of the crypto itself.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Finding APY:</strong> Look for the{" "}
                <strong>current estimated APY</strong> provided by the specific
                staking pool, validator, or platform (like an exchange) you plan
                to use. Be cautious of unusually high advertised rates, as they
                might carry higher risks.

              How Does This Calculator Estimate Rewards?
            </h2>
            <p>
              This tool uses the information you provide (Amount Staked,
              Estimated APY, Staking Duration) to calculate the potential growth
              of your staked assets. It applies the provided APY using a
              standard calculation method (often assuming some level of
              compounding, though the exact method can vary between
              calculators).
            </p>
            <p className="font-bold">Input Guidance:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Staking Amount:</strong> The number of coins you plan to
                stake.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Estimated APY (%):</strong> The{" "}
                <strong>current Annual Percentage Yield</strong> advertised by
                your chosen validator or platform. Remember this is an estimate
                and can change. Input it as a percentage (e.g., enter
                &apos;5&apos; for 5%).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Staking Duration:</strong> How long you plan to keep
                your coins staked (e.g., 1 year, 180 days).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The calculator outputs an *estimated* total number of coins and
              the *estimated* rewards earned over that period, based purely on
              these inputs.

              ⚠️ Understanding the Risks of Staking
            </h2>
            <p>
              Staking is not risk-free. Before locking up your assets,
              understand the potential downsides:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Market Risk:</strong> The price of the cryptocurrency
                you are staking could decrease significantly, potentially
                outweighing any staking rewards earned when measured in fiat
                currency (like USD or EUR).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Lock-up Periods:</strong> Many staking protocols require
                you to lock your funds for a specific duration (days, weeks, or
                months). During this time, you cannot withdraw or sell your
                staked assets, even if the market price drops dramatically.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Slashing Penalties:</strong> If the validator you stake
                with misbehaves (e.g., goes offline for too long, validates
                fraudulent transactions), the network can penalize them by
                destroying (&quot;slashing&quot;) a portion of their staked
                coins, including yours if you delegated to them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>APY Volatility:</strong> As mentioned, the APY is not
                guaranteed. It can decrease due to various network factors,
                meaning your actual rewards might be lower than estimated.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Platform/Custodian Risk:</strong> If you stake through
                an exchange or third-party platform, you are exposed to their
                security risks (hacks) and counterparty risk (insolvency).
                &quot;Not your keys, not your coins&quot; applies.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Smart Contract Risk:</strong> Staking often involves
                interacting with smart contracts, which could potentially have
                bugs or vulnerabilities that could be exploited, leading to loss
                of funds.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Technical Complexity:</strong> Staking directly often
                requires some technical understanding. Incorrect setup could
                lead to missed rewards or even slashing.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Always weigh the potential rewards against these significant
              risks.

                  <strong>No, absolutely not.</strong> The results are purely
                  mathematical estimates based on the APY you enter. Actual
                  rewards depend heavily on real-time network conditions,
                  validator performance, and potential changes in the APY
                  itself. They can be higher or lower than the estimate.

                <p className="mb-0">
                  APR (Annual Percentage Rate) typically represents the simple

                  Yield) usually accounts for the effect of compounding (earning
                  interest on interest). APY will generally be slightly higher
                  than APR if rewards are compounded frequently. Ensure you know

                  <strong>Yes.</strong> While staking aims to generate rewards,
                  you can lose principal due to slashing penalties if your
                  chosen validator misbehaves. You can also effectively lose
                  value if the market price of the staked asset drops
                  significantly. Additionally, platform hacks or smart contract
                  bugs could lead to losses.
