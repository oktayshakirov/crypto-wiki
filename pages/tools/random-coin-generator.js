            <h2 className="h3 my-4">What is the Random Coin Generator?</h2>
            <p>
              With thousands of cryptocurrencies in existence, exploring the
              market can feel overwhelming. The Random Coin Generator is a
              simple tool designed to combat this by presenting you with a
              single cryptocurrency selected randomly from our defined list
              (currently the {coinListScope} sourced from {dataSource}).
            </p>
            <p>
              Think of it as a digital &quot;spin the wheel&quot; for crypto
              discovery. Its purpose is <strong>not</strong> to suggest
              investments, but to offer a random starting point if you want to
              learn about a coin you might not have encountered otherwise.
            </p>

            <h2 className="h3 my-4">How Does This Generator Work?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Coin Selection Pool:</strong> We maintain a list of
                cryptocurrencies based on our defined scope ({coinListScope})
                using data from {dataSource}. This list is updated periodically
                ({listUpdateFrequency}).
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Randomization:</strong> When you click the button, a
                standard computer algorithm randomly selects one coin from this
                current list.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Display:</strong> The tool then displays basic
                information about the selected coin (e.g., name, ticker, logo).
                <em>
                  Ideally, your component also provides links to reputable
                  external sources like CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap for further
                  research.
                </em>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The selection is purely random based on the available list; there
              is no weighting or filtering based on quality, potential, or
              safety.
            </p>

              How to Use This Tool <strong>Responsibly</strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
              Using this tool for entertainment is fine, but if you use it as a
              starting point for research, follow these steps{" "}
              <strong>critically</strong>:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Generate a Coin:</strong> Click the button.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Note the Details:</strong> Write down the name and
                ticker symbol.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>IGNORE Any Impulse to Invest:</strong> Treat the result
                as nothing more than a random name.{" "}
                <strong>Do not assume it has value or potential.</strong>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Begin Independent Research (DYOR):</strong> Use
                reputable, independent sources (e.g., CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap,
                official project website, <em>not</em> just social media hype)
                to investigate:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Project Basics:</strong> What problem does it solve?
                    What is its use case?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Team & Technology:</strong> Is the team known and
                    credible? Is the technology sound?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Tokenomics:</strong> What is the coin&apos;s supply,
                    distribution, and utility?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Market Data:</strong> Check Market Cap, 24h Trading
                    Volume (is it liquid?), historical price action, and
                    exchange listings (is it on major exchanges?).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Community & Activity:</strong> Is there an active
                    development team and community? Check GitHub activity. Be
                    wary of pure hype.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Red Flags:</strong> Look for signs of potential
                    scams (anonymous team, unrealistic promises, low liquidity,
                    poor website/whitepaper).
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Assess Risk:</strong> Understand that investing in{" "}
                <em>any</em>
                cryptocurrency is risky, and investing in lesser-known coins
                selected randomly is <strong>exponentially riskier</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consult an Advisor:</strong> If, after extensive
                research, you are still considering an investment, discuss it
                with a qualified financial advisor who understands your risk
                tolerance.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Remember, the vast majority of cryptocurrencies fail or have very
              little value. Random selection does not improve your odds.

                Generating a random coin does NOT mean it is safe, valuable, or

            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>High Chance of Low Quality:</strong> Depending on the
                coin list scope, you might generate inactive projects, meme
                coins with no utility, or outright scams.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Illiquidity Risk:</strong> Many smaller coins have very
                low trading volume, meaning you might not be able to sell them
                easily if you buy them.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Volatility:</strong> Smaller coins can experience
                extreme price swings (both up and down) very quickly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Scams & Rug Pulls:</strong> The crypto space, especially
                outside the top established projects, is rife with scams where
                developers disappear with investors&apos; money.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>No Guarantee of Value:</strong> A randomly generated
                coin has no inherent guarantee of current or future value. Its
                selection by this tool is meaningless from an investment
                perspective.
