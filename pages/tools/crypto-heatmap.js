          <h2 className="h3 my-4">What is a Crypto Heatmap?</h2>
          <p>
            A crypto heatmap is a visual tool that shows the price movement and
            market sentiment of various cryptocurrencies. In this heatmap, green
            represents a positive price change, while red indicates a negative
            price change. This enables users to quickly identify which coins are
            gaining or losing value in real time.
          </p>

          <h2 className="h3 my-4">How to Use the Crypto Heatmap?</h2>
          <p>
            The crypto heatmap is designed to help traders and investors make
            informed decisions. By observing the green and red blocks, users can
            quickly assess which cryptocurrencies are performing well and which
            are experiencing declines. While green signifies growth and could
            indicate buying opportunities, red highlights declines, signaling
            caution. However, it&apos;s important to combine this with other
            analysis tools and not rely on the heatmap alone for investment
            decisions.
