At TheCrypto.Wiki, we value transparency and trust. To maintain our operations and provide free educational content, we feature various types of advertising. These include affiliate links, sponsored content, and third-party advertisements. Below is a detailed explanation of our advertising practices.

### Types of Advertising

- **Affiliate Links**: Some of our articles include affiliate links, meaning we may earn a commission if you purchase a product or service through these links. This comes at no additional cost to you.
- **Sponsored Content**: Occasionally, we collaborate with companies to promote their products or services. Such articles or posts are clearly labeled as "Sponsored Content."
- **Third-Party Ads**: We work with advertising networks, such as Google AdSense, to display ads on our website. These ads are managed by third-party platforms and are not directly controlled by us.

### Our Commitment to Transparency

- Products and services featured in our content are selected based on thorough research and relevance to our audience. Compensation does not influence our reviews or recommendations.
- We clearly label all sponsored content to ensure readers can easily distinguish it from editorial content.

### Your Trust Matters

We dedicate significant time and effort to provide accurate, up-to-date, and useful information to our readers. Our advertising partnerships help support this mission while adhering to ethical journalism practices. Your trust is our priority, and we strive to maintain the highest standards of integrity in all content we produce.
