Ethereum is one of the most influential and widely used blockchain platforms in the world. While [Bitcoin](/posts/what-is-bitcoin) often takes the spotlight as the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, Ethereum has carved out its niche by offering a platform that goes far beyond just digital currency. This guide will introduce you to Ethereum, explain how it works, and explore why it’s such a significant player in the cryptocurrency space.

## **What is Ethereum?**

Launched in 2015 by a team of developers led by [Vitalik Buterin](/crypto-ogs/vitalik-buterin), Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications (dApps). Unlike Bitcoin, which is primarily designed as a digital currency, Ethereum was created to facilitate smart contracts and applications that run on a decentralized network.

Ethereum is often referred to as a “world computer” because of its potential to decentralize the internet by replacing traditional servers with thousands of nodes run by volunteers worldwide. This vision of decentralizing not just currency but also applications and services makes Ethereum unique and positions it as a cornerstone of Web3, the next generation of the internet.

## **Ethereum’s Role in Web3**

Ethereum is more than just a blockchain; it’s the backbone of Web3, a decentralized vision of the internet where users control their data, identity, and interactions. Web3 is a response to the limitations of Web2, where centralized platforms dominate and often exploit user data for profit.

### **Ethereum’s Contributions to Web3**

- **Ownership of Digital Assets:** Unlike centralized platforms, Ethereum allows users to own and control their digital assets, such as NFTs, directly on the blockchain.
- **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** Ethereum’s infrastructure supports DeFi protocols that eliminate intermediaries like banks, offering financial services to anyone with an internet connection.
- **Self-Sovereign Identity:** Ethereum-based identity solutions, such as **ENS (Ethereum Name Service)**, give users full control over their digital identities.

## **Ethereum vs. Bitcoin: Key Differences**

While both Ethereum and Bitcoin are built on blockchain technology, they serve different purposes and have distinct features:

- **Purpose**: Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency designed to function as an alternative to traditional money. Ethereum, on the other hand, is a platform for building decentralized applications, with its cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH), used to power these applications.
- **Blockchain Functionality**: Bitcoin’s blockchain is primarily used to record transactions, while Ethereum’s blockchain can execute code and run applications through smart contracts.
- **Supply**: Bitcoin has a capped supply of 21 million coins, whereas Ether does not have a fixed supply, though changes in Ethereum’s protocol have introduced mechanisms to limit inflation.

## **How Ethereum Works**

Ethereum operates as a decentralized network of nodes, each maintaining a copy of the blockchain. The platform allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts—self-executing pieces of code stored on the blockchain.

### **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)**

At the heart of Ethereum’s functionality is the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The EVM acts as a decentralized computer that processes and executes smart contracts. It ensures that all nodes in the Ethereum network reach consensus on the outcome of transactions, making it a reliable and tamper-proof system.

#### **EVM Use Cases**

- **Smart Contract Execution:** Running DeFi protocols like **Compound** or **MakerDAO**.
- **Token Standards:** Enabling the creation of ERC-20 tokens (fungible) and ERC-721 tokens (non-fungible).
- **Cross-Chain Interactions:** Facilitating interoperability with other blockchains via bridges like **Polygon** and **Avalanche**.

## **What Makes Smart Contracts Unique?**

Smart contracts are the defining feature of Ethereum. These self-executing agreements eliminate intermediaries, reducing costs and increasing trust between parties.

### **Applications of Smart Contracts**

- **Insurance Automation:** Automatically paying out claims when predefined conditions are met, such as flight delays. For instance, a flight insurance smart contract can access live flight data and issue compensation to passengers automatically in case of delays or cancellations.
- **Real Estate Transactions:** Streamlining the property buying process by transferring ownership once payments clear. Smart contracts can also be used to manage rental agreements, ensuring that funds are transferred to landlords automatically on specified dates.
- **Gaming Economies:** Rewarding players with in-game assets or tokens, as seen in **Axie Infinity**. Blockchain-based games like **Gods Unchained** also utilize smart contracts to mint and trade unique game cards as NFTs.
- **Supply Chain Management:** Automating payments between suppliers and manufacturers once goods are delivered and verified. For example, a smart contract can release funds as soon as a shipment is scanned at its destination.
- **Healthcare Payments:** Automating claims processing for patients and insurers. Smart contracts can verify patient eligibility and process payments without manual intervention, reducing delays and fraud.
- **Freelance Work Agreements:** Platforms like **LaborX** use smart contracts to ensure freelancers receive payments automatically upon project completion and client approval.
- **Crowdfunding:** Managing contributions and ensuring refunds if fundraising goals are not met. For example, platforms like **Gitcoin** use smart contracts to fund open-source projects transparently.
- **Royalty Distribution:** Ensuring fair and automatic royalty payments for artists, musicians, and content creators whenever their work is purchased or streamed. Platforms like **Audius** use smart contracts to reward creators in real-time.
- **Charitable Donations:** Smart contracts can ensure that donations reach their intended recipients, and funds are used only for specified purposes, providing greater transparency to donors.
- **Voting Systems:** Powering secure and transparent voting platforms where votes are recorded immutably, ensuring election integrity without the need for centralized oversight.

By leveraging smart contracts, industries can achieve greater efficiency, transparency, and trust, ultimately reducing costs and the potential for disputes.
