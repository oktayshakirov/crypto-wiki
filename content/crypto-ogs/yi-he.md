Yi He attributes much of her success to the strength of the team at Binance, noting the importance of hiring the best talent and fostering collaboration.

## Future Vision: Global Expansion & Leadership

As Binance continues to expand its global footprint, Yi He has set her sights on strengthening the company’s presence in key regions such as Europe and the Middle East.
