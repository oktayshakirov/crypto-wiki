Gavin Wood, co-founder of **Ethereum** and founder of **Polkadot**, has been a key figure in the development of blockchain technology, particularly in enabling smart contracts and blockchain interoperability. Known for his deep technical expertise, Wood was instrumental in designing the Ethereum platform and later created Polkadot to solve limitations he observed in early blockchain systems.

> “Blockchain should be about enabling innovation, collaboration, and freedom in a decentralized world.” – Gavin Wood

## Early Life and Education

Gavin Wood was born in 1980 in Lancaster, England. With a strong academic background in computer science, he earned a Ph.D. from the University of York, where his research focused on peer-to-peer networking and decentralized systems. Wood's technical expertise, coupled with a passion for decentralization, led him into the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

### Interesting Facts about Gavin Wood

- **Ethereum's Technical Architect**: Wood was the first to propose and implement Ethereum's smart contracts, fundamentally shaping the platform. He authored the **Ethereum Yellow Paper**, the technical specification for Ethereum, and developed its first functional implementation.
- **Polkadot Vision**: After leaving Ethereum in 2016, Wood founded **Polkadot**, a blockchain that allows multiple blockchains to operate together, solving the problem of interoperability in the crypto world.
- **Parity Technologies**: Wood also co-founded **Parity Technologies**, the company responsible for building the Polkadot ecosystem and one of the most innovative blockchain companies in the space.
- **Substrate Framework**: Wood designed the **Substrate** blockchain framework, enabling developers to create custom blockchains that can interact with the Polkadot network.

## The Birth of Ethereum

Wood is best known for his work in creating **Ethereum**, the second-largest blockchain platform by market capitalization after Bitcoin. Alongside [Vitalik Buterin](/crypto-ogs/vitalik-buterin), Wood helped launch Ethereum in 2015, transforming the cryptocurrency landscape with the introduction of **smart contracts**—self-executing agreements written in code. His technical contributions made Ethereum a more flexible platform than Bitcoin, capable of supporting decentralized applications (dApps) and various innovations in the crypto space.

### Key Milestones

- **2013**: Co-founds Ethereum and writes the Ethereum Yellow Paper.
- **2015**: Ethereum is launched with smart contracts, driven by Wood's technical architecture.
- **2016**: Leaves Ethereum to pursue the vision of Polkadot.
- **2020**: Polkadot mainnet launches, focusing on blockchain interoperability.

## Polkadot: Solving Blockchain Interoperability

After Ethereum, Gavin Wood shifted his focus to solving one of the most pressing problems in blockchain: **interoperability**. In 2016, he founded **Polkadot**, a blockchain network that enables different blockchains to communicate with one another, share data, and leverage each other’s strengths. Polkadot’s vision is to create a fully decentralized web, where users are in control of their data and transactions.

Polkadot uses a unique structure called **parachains**, which allows blockchains to run in parallel, reducing congestion and improving scalability.
