**Vasiliy Shapovalov** is a prominent blockchain developer and entrepreneur, best known for co-founding **Lido**, a leading **Ethereum liquid staking** protocol. With over a decade of experience in software development and project management, Shapovalov has become a key figure in decentralized finance (DeFi). He currently serves as the **Chief Technology Officer (CTO)** at **P2P Validator**, one of the top staking providers globally. Shapovalov’s technical expertise and leadership have positioned him as an important contributor to the future of blockchain and liquid staking.

## Early Life & Education

Vasiliy Shapovalov holds a **Master’s degree in Applied Mathematics** from the **Southern Federal University** (formerly Rostov State University) in Russia. His background in mathematics laid the groundwork for his deep interest in systems design, cryptography, and blockchain technology.

## Early Career

Shapovalov’s career in technology began in the mid-2000s, with roles in software development. He worked as a software developer at **OOO Content.RU** and later at **ANGSTREM JSC**, where he honed his skills in project management and development. By 2010, Shapovalov advanced to a leadership position at the **Research Institute**, where he served as **Deputy Department Manager** and managed projects related to information security, virtualization, and formal verification.

He transitioned into the blockchain space in 2017, working as a blockchain developer at **Digmus**, where he began exploring the potential of decentralized systems.

## Blockchain Journey and Co-founding Lido

In 2020, Shapovalov co-founded **Lido**, one of the most widely used Ethereum-based liquid staking protocols. **Lido** enables users to stake **Ethereum (ETH)** and receive **stETH**, a liquid token that represents their stake. This mechanism allows users to earn rewards from staking while maintaining liquidity, making Lido one of the most popular DeFi protocols for Ethereum staking.

Shapovalov’s contributions to Lido have been critical in the development and success of the protocol. Under his leadership, Lido raised **$2 million** from major investors, including **ParaFi Capital**, **Terra**, **Semantic Ventures**, and **Rune Christensen** (founder of MakerDAO). By December 2020, Lido launched its staking service, which quickly became a core component of Ethereum’s liquid staking ecosystem.

In March 2022, Lido secured a **$70 million investment** from **Andreessen Horowitz**, further boosting the protocol’s growth and cementing its position in the liquid staking industry.

Lido's success was driven by its innovative staking model, which solved the issue of illiquidity in Ethereum 2.0 staking. Users could stake their ETH and still have the freedom to use stETH in decentralized finance applications, such as lending and yield farming, creating a dynamic and versatile staking environment.

## Chief Technology Officer at P2P Validator

Since 2020, Vasiliy Shapovalov has also held the role of **Chief Technology Officer** at **P2P Validator**, a staking provider supporting multiple blockchain networks. P2P Validator specializes in secure and efficient staking services for various cryptocurrencies, ensuring users can participate in the validation process while earning rewards. Shapovalov’s technical leadership at P2P Validator has enabled the platform to expand and support a wide range of blockchain networks.

## Thought Leadership: The Future of Liquid Staking

At the **Devcon Bogotá 2022** event, Shapovalov spoke about the **future of liquid staking**, predicting that the market would likely consolidate around a few key protocols, with Lido and centralized exchanges being the dominant players. He emphasized that while centralized platforms have economic advantages, the future of liquid staking should ideally be decentralized to preserve Ethereum’s values.

> "We are very much dependent on the whole DeFi stack to win against the CeFi options. The only thing that CeFi does better than DeFi right now… is probably just capital efficiency."

Shapovalov believes that DeFi will improve over time, enhancing capital efficiency and positioning liquid staking as a vital part of the decentralized financial ecosystem.

He also highlighted the risk of centralization in Ethereum staking and proposed a **limit on Lido’s market share** to mitigate the potential risks posed by Lido's governance power. Shapovalov’s proposal sparked a debate within the Ethereum community, with notable figures such as **Vitalik Buterin** supporting the idea of limiting the market share of large staking protocols like Lido.

## Expansion into DeFi: Chainlink Integration

In 2022, **Lido** integrated **Chainlink** price feeds to enhance the utility of **stETH** in decentralized finance applications, such as yield farming and money markets. Shapovalov emphasized the importance of Chainlink’s reliable oracle solutions in expanding the DeFi ecosystem and enabling the secure use of stETH in various applications.

> "Chainlink effectively serves as an important enabler for DeFi protocols looking to add support for assets like stETH quickly and securely."

This integration represents a significant step in expanding the DeFi ecosystem around Lido’s liquid staking services, making stETH a key asset in decentralized financial markets.
