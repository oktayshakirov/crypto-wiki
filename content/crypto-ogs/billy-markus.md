**Billy Markus**, a former software engineer at **IBM**, is best known as the co-creator of **Dogecoin**, the meme-based cryptocurrency that started as a joke but has since gained a massive following. Known by his Twitter handle, **"Shibetoshi Nakamoto"**, Billy's witty persona and ongoing engagement with the crypto community have made him a significant figure in the world of cryptocurrency.

## The Creation of Dogecoin

In 2013, Markus teamed up with **[Jackson Palmer](/crypto-ogs/jackson-palmer)** to create **Dogecoin**, initially intended to be a parody of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency space. Inspired by the viral **Doge meme**, Dogecoin quickly gained traction for its playful branding and enthusiastic community.

Billy Markus has been candid about how quickly the project took off. He recalls coming across the **dogecoin.com** domain, registered by Palmer, and deciding to create the actual coin in a matter of hours. The cryptocurrency was officially launched on **December 6, 2013**, and immediately attracted attention for its lighthearted take on the world of blockchain.

> "I ran across the website randomly and thought it would be funny to make the actual Dogecoin. I threw it together in a few hours, and we launched it, and then it took off, and lots of crazy stuff happened since."

## Leaving Dogecoin Behind

Despite the coin's rising popularity, Markus distanced himself from Dogecoin in **2015**, selling all of his holdings in the cryptocurrency. He publicly voiced his discomfort with how the community had shifted, explaining that the focus had moved away from the fun, inclusive spirit that Dogecoin was originally built on. Markus has said that his departure was also fueled by personal attacks and criticism from some in the crypto community.

> "As I mentioned on my Twitter, I'm no longer part of the Dogecoin project. I left around 2015 as the community started to strongly shift from one that I was comfortable with."

Markus has also revealed that when he sold his Dogecoin, the proceeds were enough to buy a **used Honda Civic**, highlighting his own lighthearted view of the crypto project he co-created.

## Personal Life and Views on Cryptocurrency

Though he stepped away from active involvement in Dogecoin, Billy Markus has remained connected to the world of crypto through **Twitter**, where he regularly comments on the state of the industry. He is often critical of the scams and shady behavior prevalent in the space, once famously tweeting:

> “The reason why people think crypto is 95% scams and garbage, and most crypto people are a**\*\*\*** is because crypto is 95% scams and garbage, and most crypto people are a**\*\*\***.”

Markus continues to live a modest life, working from home to develop **educational software** for children. Despite the fame Dogecoin has brought him, Markus is not interested in returning to the world of cryptocurrency as a developer and has resisted offers to work with figures like **[Elon Musk](/crypto-ogs/elon-musk)**. In response to questions about working for Musk, he humorously stated:

> "He seems to tolerate me on the internet. I have never met him in person."

## The Impact of Dogecoin and Beyond

Markus may have left Dogecoin behind, but the cryptocurrency continues to thrive, largely driven by Musk's tweets and public endorsements. Markus, however, maintains a skeptical view of the crypto industry, even as Dogecoin reached new heights in early 2021. He remains an active observer of the space, often sharing his thoughts with his large Twitter following.

Despite his skepticism, Billy Markus is still respected for the role he played in creating one of the most well-known meme coins in the world. **Dogecoin** has outgrown its origins as a joke, transforming into a cryptocurrency that is widely used and recognized. Although Markus no longer plays an active role in Dogecoin, his creation has left a lasting mark on the industry.
