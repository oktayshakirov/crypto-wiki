It empowers users to invest in a range of assets—from traditional equities and ETFs to cryptocurrencies—within a regulated and secure environment. Unlike typical crypto-only exchanges, Trade Republic integrates digital assets alongside stocks and ETFs, offering a more holistic and convenient approach to portfolio management.

Trade Republic breaks down investment barriers by offering:

- **Stocks & ETFs**: Zero-commission trading on a variety of global stocks and ETFs, enabling diversified portfolios at a low cost.
- **Derivatives**: Tap into options, futures, and other derivatives to hedge risk or leverage market opportunities.
- **Cryptocurrencies**: Buy and sell popular digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum in the same account you use for traditional securities.
- **Fractional Shares**: Invest in fractions of leading companies, starting with as little as €1, making markets more accessible to all.

### 2. Regulated and Secure Environment

Security and compliance are at the heart of Trade Republic’s operations:

- **EU Regulation**: Operating under European financial oversight ensures a legally compliant and transparent trading environment that adheres to investor protection rules.
- **Trusted Custodians**: Partnered custodial services handle asset storage, reducing complexity and improving reliability for both traditional and digital assets.
