I’m missing the structured inputs—your placeholders didn’t resolve—so I don’t have the exchange details, template, or internal link maps required to write this review to spec. Please provide the following so I can deliver a 1,500–2,500 word review that follows your exact sections, tone, disclaimers, and internal linking rules:

Required inputs
- Exchange basics: name, official website, slug, assigned order, today’s date (ISO), year founded, HQ/jurisdictions, availability by region, company entity/entities.
- Founders/executives: names and roles. If they’re in your OG map, include their slugs so I can link them as [Name](/crypto-ogs/{slug}).
- Product scope: spot, derivatives (perps/futures), margin/borrowing, staking/earn, Launchpad/IEO, copy trading, P2P/OTC, card, DeFi integrations, NFT, API/market maker programs, proof-of-reserves details.
- Listings and markets: number of coins/pairs, notable fiat on-ramps/off-ramps, supported fiat currencies, payment rails (cards, bank transfer, SEPA, ACH, Faster Payments, etc.).
- Fees: spot taker/maker tiers, derivatives fees, P2P fees, deposit/withdrawal fees, spreads, VIP program details and thresholds, fee discounts (token holdings, volume, referrals).
- Security: custody model (hot/cold %, MPC/HSM), insurance/funds (SAFU, crime insurance), audits (PoR specifics, auditor, frequency), bug bounty, past incidents and outcomes, 2FA options, allowlist/withdrawal controls.
- Compliance: licenses/registrations (e.g., VASP, EMI, MSB, MiCA progress), KYC tiers/limits, geo-restrictions, sanctions screening, travel rule support.
- Transparency and governance: ownership structure, proof-of-reserves liabilities methodology, public financials (if any), transparency reports.
- User experience: mobile/web apps, order types, charting, UX strengths/weaknesses, customer support channels/SLAs, languages.
- Liquidity and reliability: reported 24h volumes (spot/derivs), depth metrics (e.g., 1% market depth for BTC/ETH), uptime/SLA, market quality notes.
- Education and research: academy/research, in-app warnings, risk disclosures, demo trading.
- Target audience: traders (retail/pro), regions, use cases.
- Competitive set: 2–4 comparable exchanges to reference for context.

Internal linking maps
- CRYPTO_OGS map: array of { name, slug } so I can auto-link founders via [Name](/crypto-ogs/{slug}).
- POSTS map: array of { title, slug } for auto-linking educational terms like [KYC](/posts/{slug}) or [proof of reserves](/posts/{slug}). If you prefer, list the exact terms I should link to which slugs.

House style assets
- The exact review template (section headings and order), tone notes, required disclaimers, and any “do/don’t” rules.
- Any callouts or pros/cons you want emphasized, plus legal compliance notes I must include for certain jurisdictions.

Optional but helpful
- Screenshots or feature highlights you want referenced (I’ll write descriptive image alt text accordingly).
- Any affiliate disclosures, promo codes, or current campaigns (with terms and regional eligibility).

Once I have these, I’ll produce the review with the exact section headings, balanced strengths/limitations, E-E-A-T framing, descriptive image alt text, and the required internal links.
