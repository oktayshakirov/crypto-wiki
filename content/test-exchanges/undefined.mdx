I’m ready to write the review, but I’m missing the required template and metadata. Please provide the following so I can strictly follow your guidelines:

- Full review template and style guidelines (exact section headings, tone, disclaimers, internal linking rules, image requirements)
- Exchange name (actual brand) and official website URL
- Slug to use for the page
- Today’s date (if it needs to be referenced in the copy)
- Assigned order (if it affects positioning or comparisons)
- Internal link maps:
  - CRYPTO_OGS: list of founders with names and slugs to link (e.g., [Name](/crypto-ogs/{slug}))
  - POSTS: list of educational concepts with titles and slugs (e.g., [Title](/posts/{slug}))
- Any must-include facts: licenses/registrations, supported countries, product lineup (spot, derivatives, staking, earn, card), fee schedule, security practices, proof-of-reserves details
- Specific competitors for the “Alternatives” or “How it compares” section
- Any restricted claims or compliance notes (e.g., “not available in X”, leverage limits, staking caveats)
- Brand voice nuances (e.g., neutral journalistic vs. opinionated analyst)

If you don’t have the guidelines handy, I can proceed with a standard exchange review structure and neutral tone. Please confirm if that’s acceptable.
