I’m missing the required inputs to follow your review template. Please provide:

- The full guidelines/template text with exact section headings, tone, and disclaimers.
- Internal link maps:
  - CRYPTO_OGS: list of founders with names and slugs (for [Name](/crypto-ogs/{slug}) links).
  - POSTS: list of educational posts with titles and slugs (for [Title](/posts/{slug}) links).
- Exchange metadata: name, official website, slug, assigned order, and today’s date.

Once you share these, I’ll produce the 1,500–2,500 word review using the exact structure and internal links.
