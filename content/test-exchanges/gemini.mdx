Founded in 2014 by the twin entrepreneurs [Cameron Winklevoss](/crypto-ogs/cameron-winklevoss) and [Tyler Winklevoss](/crypto-ogs/tyler-winklevoss), Gemini is a New York–based cryptocurrency exchange and qualified custodian positioned as a compliance-first platform for both retail and institutions. Operating under a New York State Trust charter, Gemini emphasizes regulated custody, transparent operations, and a clean user experience across its web, mobile, and professional trading interfaces. It competes with larger global venues while maintaining a U.S.-centric regulatory posture and institutional-grade services.

Core Services
- **Spot trading and pairs**: Gemini supports 100+ cryptocurrencies and 200+ trading pairs, covering majors like [Bitcoin](/posts/what-is-bitcoin) and [Ethereum](/posts/what-is-ethereum) alongside a curated list of altcoins. The platform offers three primary interfaces: a simple buy/sell UI for beginners, the professional-grade ActiveTrader orderbook for advanced users, and robust APIs (REST and WebSocket) for programmatic trading.
- **Derivatives (select jurisdictions)**: Through its non-U.S. affiliates, Gemini offers perpetual futures on large-cap assets (e.g., BTC and ETH) to eligible users outside the United States. Leverage limits, margin requirements, and contract availability vary by jurisdiction; U.S. customers are not eligible. Trading derivatives carries significant risk, and Gemini applies eligibility screening, risk controls, and real-time margining where offered.
- **Custody and treasury services**: As a qualified custodian, Gemini provides institutional-grade cold storage with segregated accounts, audit-friendly reporting, and operational tooling (allowlisting, multi-user permissions). Institutional clients can integrate custody with trading operations, reducing settlement friction while maintaining policy controls. Gemini also issues Gemini Dollar (GUSD), a U.S. dollar–backed stablecoin with regular attestations and programmatic mint/redeem support.
- **Staking (jurisdiction-dependent)**: Gemini has offered staking on select networks (e.g., ETH), with carefully scoped availability depending on local rules. Rewards, slashing protections, and lock-up terms vary by chain. Staking is not available in all regions and may be paused or adjusted based on regulatory guidance. If you are new to staking, review the basics: [What Is Staking](/posts/what-is-staking).
- **Fiat on/off ramps**: Gemini supports ACH, wire transfers, and debit card purchases in supported regions. USD is the primary base currency in the U.S., with additional fiat options available in the U.K. and EU via Gemini’s regional entities and partners. Users can set up recurring buys and one-time purchases and withdraw to linked bank accounts.
- **Credit card and rewards**: In the U.S., the Gemini Credit Card offers crypto rewards (paid in your chosen asset) with no annual fee, integrating directly with your account. Reward rates vary by category and may be adjusted; terms are jurisdiction-specific.
- **Institutional connectivity**: Gemini caters to funds, family offices, and corporates via API connectivity, FIX gateways, block trading workflows, and bespoke onboarding. The custodian and exchange can be combined for operational simplicity with compliance controls for audit and reporting.
- **NFT marketplace (Nifty Gateway)**: Gemini’s group includes Nifty Gateway, an NFT platform focused on curated drops and fiat-friendly onboarding. While the NFT market is cyclical and speculative, the integration provides a compliant route to digital collectibles that align with broader [DeFi](/posts/what-is-defi) and Web3 exploration.

Security Measures
- **Account security**: Gemini supports industry-standard 2FA via authenticator apps and hardware security keys (WebAuthn), device management, and withdrawal address allowlisting for enhanced protection. Session monitoring, login alerts, and role-based permissions for institutional accounts help mitigate account takeover risk.
- **Custody architecture**: The majority of customer digital assets are stored in geographically distributed cold storage secured by multi-signature approvals and Hardware Security Modules (HSMs). Hot wallet balances are minimized and monitored. Gemini has emphasized independent audits and SOC 2 Type II compliance across systems and controls.
- **Insurance and disclaimers**: Gemini has historically maintained insurance coverage for certain hot-wallet balances; however, coverage limits and terms apply and do not extend to all losses or assets. Insurance is not a substitute for prudent security practices, and it does not guarantee reimbursement in the event of counterparty failure or extreme events.
- **Historical incidents**: Gemini has not suffered a headline exchange wallet hack to date, but it experienced third-party-related data exposure incidents (e.g., customer email list leaks) that heightened phishing risks. The halted Gemini Earn program (partnered with Genesis) in November 2022 was a counterparty event rather than a platform security breach; nevertheless, it illustrates the systemic risk of lending programs and off-balance-sheet exposures.
- **Self-custody guidance**: Regardless of exchange reputation, assets held on Gemini are under Gemini’s custody and subject to operational, legal, and counterparty risk. Consider a hardware wallet and best practices for long-term holdings: **[How To Store Crypto](/posts/how-to-store-crypto)** and protect yourself from social engineering and phishing: **[How to Avoid Crypto Scams](/posts/how-to-avoid-crypto-scams)**.

User Experience
- **Interfaces**: The default web/mobile interface targets beginners with clear pricing, fiat rails, and recurring orders. ActiveTrader presents a professional layout with order book, depth chart, advanced order types (limit, stop-limit), and fee tier visibility. Execution and charting are clean and responsive; market and limit orders are straightforward to configure.
- **APIs and automation**: REST and WebSocket APIs provide market data, order management, and account endpoints with granular permissions. Institutional users can access FIX connectivity. Latency is competitive for a U.S.-regulated venue, though global traders seeking the tightest spreads may compare liquidity with **[Binance](/exchanges/binance)** or **[OKX](/exchanges/okx)**.
- **Education and research**: Gemini’s “Cryptopedia” produces explainers on assets, security, and market structure. For macro sentiment, traders often consult tools like the **[Fear and Greed Index](/tools/fear-and-greed-index)**, and compare liquidity depth across venues such as **[Coinbase](/exchanges/coinbase)**, **[Kraken](/exchanges/kraken)**, **[KuCoin](/exchanges/kucoin)**, and **[Crypto.com](/exchanges/crypto-com)** to assess execution quality.
- **Customer support**: Support is offered via email tickets and help-center documentation. Response times have improved over past cycles but can still lengthen during high-volatility periods. Identity verification is generally smooth, but users with complex entity structures should expect additional compliance checks.

Regulatory Compliance
- **U.S. trust company**: Gemini Trust Company, LLC is a New York State–chartered trust company supervised by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). This structure imposes capital requirements, cybersecurity standards, and regulatory examinations that exceed typical money services registrations.
- **International footprint**: Gemini operates affiliated entities in the U.K. and EU with applicable registrations and e-money/virtual asset permissions, including anti-money laundering (AML) supervision. In recent years, Gemini designated Dublin as its EU hub and has maintained U.K. operations under the evolving FCA cryptoasset regime. Availability varies by country and may change with local rules.
- **Enforcement and litigation history**: 
  - In 2022, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed a civil complaint alleging misleading statements related to a 2017-era bitcoin futures product; litigation has continued through subsequent years without a widely publicized final resolution as of this writing.
  - In January 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged Gemini and Genesis over the Earn program as an unregistered securities offering; related matters have moved through court and bankruptcy processes.
  - In late 2023, the New York Attorney General filed a civil suit connected to the Earn program. During 2024, Gemini announced that distributions to Earn users commenced through the Genesis bankruptcy estate, with communications indicating expectations of full asset recovery in kind for many users, subject to court approvals and process timelines.
- **Product restrictions**: Derivatives and certain yield/staking features are unavailable in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Local rules (e.g., advertising standards in the U.K., consumer disclosures in the EU, and Travel Rule compliance) shape product marketing and onboarding. Users must verify the legality and availability of Gemini in their country before attempting to open or fund an account.
- **KYC/AML**: Full identity verification (government ID, proof of address, liveness checks) is required. Corporate and institutional accounts undergo enhanced due diligence. Sanctions screening and transaction monitoring apply across regions.

Points to Consider
- **Fee structure and execution costs**: Gemini’s simple web/app interface includes a “convenience” spread (historically around 0.50%) plus a transaction fee that steps from fixed dollar amounts on small tickets ($0.99–$2.99) to roughly 1.49% for orders above $200. ActiveTrader uses a maker/taker scheme with posted rates up to 0.40% maker and 0.20% taker for low-volume tiers, declining with volume. Compare your effective total cost of ownership (spread + fees) with peers like **[Coinbase](/exchanges/coinbase)** and **[Kraken](/exchanges/kraken)**.
- **Custodial and counterparty risk**: Even with strong controls, exchange custody carries inherent risk. Keep only what you need for trading on-exchange and self-custody the rest. Read: **[How To Store Crypto](/posts/how-to-store-crypto)** and adopt allowlists, hardware keys, and limited API permissions. Be wary of off-balance-sheet products that depend on third parties.
- **Derivatives and leverage risks**: If you are eligible to access Gemini’s non-U.S. derivatives, understand that perpetual futures can amplify losses quickly. Trading derivatives, especially with high leverage, carries extreme risk and is unsuitable for most investors. Use strict risk limits, avoid cross-margin if possible, and expect liquidation under sharp moves.
- **Asset selection vs. breadth**: Gemini’s asset list is curated and smaller than global venues such as **[Binance](/exchanges/binance)** or **[OKX](/exchanges/okx)**. If you primarily trade large-cap assets and value regulatory clarity, this is a plus. If you seek deep long-tail altcoin exposure, consider complementing with a secondary venue that meets your jurisdictional requirements.
- **Regulatory overhang and availability**: While Gemini’s trust charter is a strength, ongoing U.S. regulatory actions (CFTC/SEC) and regional licensing changes can affect product rollout, staking availability, and derivatives access. Always confirm the latest supported features in your region before making a strategic move (e.g., staking ETH or planning a futures strategy).

Conclusion
Gemini occupies a compliance-first niche among centralized exchanges, pairing a U.S. trust framework with institutional-grade custody and a polished trading experience. It’s best suited for individuals and organizations who prioritize regulated operations, straightforward fiat rails, and curated asset support over maximal token variety or the deepest global derivatives menus. For long-term holders and professional treasuries, Gemini is a credible core venue—provided you pair it with prudent self-custody and an awareness of product and jurisdictional limitations.
